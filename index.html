        <p>Grader's Note: I have created a scene that fulfils all Assignment 5A's and 5B's rubic points along with adding the following bonus features:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the large vehicle, it contains textures from real Coca-Cola trucks and products.</li>
            <li>The road and grass, textured from their real life counterparts, covers the entire scene.</li>
            <li>The default origin of the directional light is from a spinning sphere in the sky, which is called the Sun.</li>
            <li>All vehicles are spaced out, just like in real life when the road is not clogged with a traffic jam.</li>
            <li>The houses, trees, tables, and chairs are all spaced out evenly, just like in a real-life suburb.</li>
            <li>All spheres in the scene are animated to spin.</li>
            <li>The lights and camera are fully customizable with a given GUI.</li>
            <li>The default colors of the hemisphere light are sky blue and grass green, which mimics their real-life counterparts.</li>
            <li>The code is structured in a way that makes development easier by splitting all code into its own seperate sections.</li>
            <li>Every non-textured object has a specular reflection.</li>
            <li>The scene's lights are the very weak ambient light, the strong directional light, and the weak hemisphere light intended to be similar to real life.</li>
            <li>The default color of the directional light is sunlight, which mimics its real-life counterpart.</li>
            <li>The default color of the ambient light is white, which mimics its real-life counterpart.</li>
        </ol>
